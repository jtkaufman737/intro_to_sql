# Introduction to SQL 

Intro to SQL workshop for Code The Dream, by Joy Kaufman 

## About

For this workshop we are going to use a mix of following slides, and writing commands into [SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/). If you get behind, the commands are going to be numbered so that you can find your spot in intro.sql to pick back up. 

## More Learning 

After this workshop I would recommend the following highly to continue your SQL practice:
- [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) This is the one I recommend the most highly! 
- [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/)
- [Code Academy SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)
- There are many T-SQL variants, but myself and a lot of others enjoy PostgreSQL the most. [This site](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) is great for all things postgres
