# Introduction to SQL 

Intro to SQL workshop for Code The Dream, by Joy Kaufman 

## About

For this workshop we are going to use a mix of following slides, and writing commands into (SQL Fiddle)[http://sqlfiddle.com/]. If you get behind, the commands are going to be numbered so that you can find your spot in intro.sql to pick back up. 

## More Learning 

After this workshop I would recommend the following highly to continue your SQL practice:
- (SQL Bolt)[https://sqlbolt.com/] _This is the one I recommend the most highly!_ 
- (SQL Zoo) [https://sqlzoo.net/]
- (Code Academy SQL)[https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql]
- The target audience has worked with Rails, you also could spin up a new database following this section of the Ruby Rails walkthrough guide, which is excellent, to practice your own queries and table creation 
- There are many T-SQL variants, but myself and a lot of others enjoy PostgreSQL the most. (This site)[https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/] is great for all things postgres
